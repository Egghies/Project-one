# Project-one
Using a database from a fake music company, "sTunes", I'm going to attempt to perform some basic exploratory data analysis using SQL and Excel, and create some basic visualizations using Tableau Public.

I've come up with some mock questions and I'll try to figure out how to solve them.

1. Which countries earn us the biggest revenue? :))))
 
2. In order to maximize sales and market appropriately, which tracks and genres sell best in each country? 

3. Even more importantly, according to each customer's purchase history, what is their favorite genre of music? We'd want to know this to give good recommendations to them.

I ran into a major problem trying to find the best selling track per country. I was summing the total revenue a track would make, but then try and assign that to a country, when in reality, I needed to find the total revenue of a track per country.
